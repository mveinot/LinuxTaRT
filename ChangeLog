 than the maximum tagline length (Colin Tuckley <colin()tuckley!org>)

3.06b

3.06
-Allow user to specify a config file at run time.
-Update documentation

3.05
-Added ability to specify a custom file at run time. (David Merriman <dkmerriman()gmail!com>)
-Added code to display the GPL notice.
-Added an item to the --help listing to show the GPL notice
-Removed "legal mumbo jumbo" notice from README, added GPL note.

3.04 (May 17, 2002):
-Switched to autoconf to manage the build process.

3.04:
-Remove newlines from displayed output. (Jörg Lippmann <joerg!lippmann()o3-software!de>)

3.03:
-Fix to allow 8-bit ASCII from custom file. (Jörg Lippmann <joerg!lippmann()o3-software!de>)

3.02:
-Really fixed bug where .TaRTrc was not created by --setup if it didn't exist
-Fixed bug that might cause daemon mode to segfault in some cases.

3.01:
-Fixed bug where signature was not displayed on update using CustomSignature
-Fixed bug where .TaRTrc was not created by --setup if it didn't exist

3.00:
-Added daemon functionality to LinuxTaRT (see README)
-Along with daemon functionality comes process management (see README)
-Command line preferences such as quiet, custom, center, etc... can be stored
in your .TaRTrc file now.
-Changed the %vi (version info) tag to return ONLY the version number, and not
the LinuxTaRT version x.xx that it used to. Update your .custom files.

2.52:
-Cleaned up some compile-time warnings on SunOS
-Don't rely on /proc/uptime to determine uptime - uptime available only on Linux
and RiscOS - if you know how to obtain it using system calls on other OSes,
send me a patch! :)
-Re-attempt iBeat support (uncomment -DIBEATS line in Makefile)
-Removed some "riscos" defined lines... this program is called LinuxTaRT
regardless of what OS it's running on... if you want it to say otherwise, use a
custom layout, or modify your copy.
-Removed patch for KMail, added documentation about an easier method to achieve
the same results (provided by Brian Hall <brianw!hall()compaq.com>)
-Fixed horribly incorrect header files (I'm amazed they compiled!)

2.51:
Had to unfortunately remove iBeat support because people seem to want time in their local
timezone more than they want iBeats.
Incorporated long awaited multiline tagline support contributed by Brian Hall <brihall()bigfoot!com>
who also fixed some small bugs. TaRT defaults to custom signatures now, as well.

2.50:
Incorporated new Internet TimeBeat code contributed by Iain Truskett as well as
RiscOS specific code for some file handling as well as uptime calculation and some
code clean-up. Many thanks to Iain! <koschei()eh!org>

2.28:
TaRT falls back on standard signature if the custom layout file is not
available.
Added 4 new tags for use in custom signatures. Allows having a time stamp
as well as a date stamp.
Improved INI/rc file interface.
Removed TaRTrcConvert utility.

2.27:
"TaRT --help" now works when you don't have a .TaRTrc file {Andreas}
When TaRT is run without a .TaRTrc file present, it now informs the user of
"TaRT --setup".
Additions to INSTALL file regarding "TaRT --setup"
Patch included to make KDE's KMail run TaRT for each new mail message.

2.26:
ChangeLog distributed with package.
Added ability to undefine the use of "uptime" for systems without /proc
Yet more corrections to the Makefiles regarding the "install" program. {Steve}
Significantly more efficient reading/writing of .TaRTrc
.TaRTrc now uses more descriptive names for the stored items, however the old
item names are still recognized for backward compatibility.
(see misc/TaRTrc-distrib)
END-INI is no longer required at the end of .TaRTrc
Free-form comments are allowed in .TaRTrc using the # symbol to denote them.
Utility included to convert your old .TaRTrc file to a new one
(see src/TaRTrcConvert/)

2.25:
Foolish oversight on my part left version 2.24 only able to parse the tilde
homedir convention ( ~/filename ) for the signature file. 2.25 fixed this
so that ~ is allowed for any of the specified files in .TaRTrc
 
2.24:
Added ability to use the tilde character in .TaRTrc to specify that a file
is in a users home directory. {Bruno}
Minor correction to the src/Makefile.

2.23:
Fixed a bug in the centering code that occurred when custom text 1 or 2 were
the maximum length allowed (caused segfault) {John S}

Some systems default to compiling char variables as unsigned. On these systems,
specifying +cust to use the custom layout produced a signature file full of
garbage. The variable that was causing this has been defined as signed in the
code so that it is compiled properly on all systems. {John S}

2.20:
First public release of LinuxTaRT.
